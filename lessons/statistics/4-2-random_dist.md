[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> ```python
>> """The CDF shows that the random numbers generated by np.random.random() are in fact uniformly distributed. The CDF produces a very straight diagonal line. The PMF is hard to read. Without rounding the PMF looks like a rectangle which is I think is indicative of uniform distribution, but it isn't easty to see exacly what is going on. To alieviate this issue I rounded the PMF input to one decimal number. In this case the PMF does appear to be uniform with a little bit of loss of uniformity near the limits."""
